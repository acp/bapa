My mom runs a WhatsApp group where a bunch of people report their reading progress on their bible, daily. These reports will then be gathered into a large message where it will show people names and their reading status.

Since I was tired of doing it manually, I created a tool, with the help of JavaScript, this task that once took 15 mins could just be 30 seconds. An automated world is lovely.

This project started as a CLI written in Node.js, grew tired of it because I'm mostly on my phone at the end of the day, so I ended up porting it into VanillaJS and hosting it on ZEIT's `now`.

You can see the old CLI app in the `nodejs` branch.
