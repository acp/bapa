My mom runs a WhatsApp group where a bunch of people report their reading progress on their bible, daily. These reports will then be gathered into a large message where it will show people names and their reading status.

Since I was tired of doing it manually, I created a tool, with the help of JavaScript, this task that once took 15 mins could just be 30 seconds. The power of technology y'all.

This project actually started as a CLI built on NodeJS, one day I grew tired of using it because people find it hard to use, I ended up porting it into a VanillaJS app, honestly, it's probably for the best.
